EyeTracker - Keeping Your Eyes on the Road
==========================================

EyeTracker warns the driver when they take their eyes off the road for too
long periods of time by sounding a warning signal. It can also be reversed,
warning the driver when they look at their phone for too long instead.

EyeTracker uses the inbuilt camera of an Android phone and the free OpenCV
library to track the face of the driver. This work fine when tracking how
long the driver is looking at their phone. When tracking how long they look
away from the road an external camera, mounted in front of the driver, could
be used to improve reliability.

This project requires that OpenCV (version 2.4.9) is added as a module. It can
be downloaded here: http://opencv.org/downloads.html

This is a project for the DAT255 Software Engineering Project course at
Chalmers University of Technology, Autumn Term 2014.
